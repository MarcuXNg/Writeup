### Steps after getting the proper legal authorization:
1. `Acquire the evidence`: Collect the digital devices such as laptops, storage devices, and digital cameras. (Note that laptops and computers require special handling if they are turned on; however, this is outside the scope of this room.)
2. `Establish a chain of custody`: Fill out the related form appropriately. The purpose is to ensure that only the authorized investigators had access to the evidence and no one could have tampered with it.
3. `Place the evidence in a secure container`: You want to ensure that the evidence does not get damaged. In the case of smartphones, you want to ensure that they cannot access the network, so they donâ€™t get wiped remotely.
4. Transport the evidence to your digital forensics lab

### Steps at the lab

1. Retrieve the digital evidence from the secure container.
2. Create a forensic copy of the evidence: The forensic copy requires advanced software to avoid modifying the original data.
3. Return the digital evidence to the secure container: You will be working on the copy. If you damage the copy, you can always create a new one.
4. Start processing the copy on your forensics workstation.

### Noted

- `Proper search authority`: Investigators cannot commence without the proper legal authority.
- `Chain of custody`: This is necessary to keep track of who was holding the evidence at any time.
- `Validation with mathematics`: Using a special kind of mathematical function, called a hash function, we can confirm that a file has not been modified.
- `Use of validated tools`: The tools used in digital forensics should be validated to ensure that they work correctly. For example, if you are creating an image of a disk, you want to ensure that the forensic image is identical to the data on the disk.
- `Repeatability`: The findings of digital forensics can be reproduced as long as the proper skills and tools are available.
- `Reporting`: The digital forensics investigation is concluded with a report that shows the evidence related to the case that was discovered.
