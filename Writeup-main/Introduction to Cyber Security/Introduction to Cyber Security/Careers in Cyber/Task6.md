### Malware Analyst
- A malware analyst's work involves analysing suspicious programs, discovering what they do and writing reports about their findings.
- converting compiled programs from machine language to readable code, usually in a low-level language
require a strong programming background, especially in low-level languages such as assembly language and C language
=> learn about all the activities that a malicious program carries out, find out how to detect it and report it.

<=> Carry out static analysis of malicious programs, which entails reverse-engineering
<=> Conduct dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activities in a controlled environment
<=> Document and report all the findings
