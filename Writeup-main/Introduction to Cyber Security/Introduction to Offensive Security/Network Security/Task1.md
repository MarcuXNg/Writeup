### Overall
- `A computer network`: a group of computers and devices connected with each other
- `Network security`:
+ Focuses on protecting the security of these devices and the links connecting them.
+ Refers to the devices, technologies, and processes to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a computer network and the data on it.
+ Consists of different hardware and software solutions to achieve the set security goals

### Hardware appliances
- `Firewall appliance`: The firewall allows and blocks connections based on a predefined set of rules. It restricts what can enter and what can leave a network.
- Intrusion Detection System (`IDS`) appliance: An IDS detects system and network intrusions and intrusion attempts. It tries to detect attackersâ€™ attempts to break into your network.
- Intrusion Prevention System (`IPS`) appliance: An IPS blocks detected intrusions and intrusion attempts. It aims to prevent attackers from breaking into your network.
- Virtual Private Network (`VPN`) concentrator appliance: A VPN ensures that the network traffic cannot be read nor altered by a third party. It protects the confidentiality (secrecy) and integrity of the sent data.

### Software security
- `Antivirus software`: detect malicious files and block them from executing.
- `Host firewall`: for example (`Windows Defender Firewall`)
