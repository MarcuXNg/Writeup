### The 7 steps of Cyber Kill Chain
1. `Recon`: short for reconnaissance, refers to the step where the attacker tries to learn as much as possible about the target(Information such as the types of servers, operating system, IP addresses, names of users, and email addresses).
2. `Weaponization`: preparing a file with a malicious component, for example, to provide the attacker with remote access.
3. `Delivery`: delivering the “weaponized” file to the target via any feasible method, such as email or USB flash memory.
4. `Exploitation`: When the user opens the malicious file, their system executes the malicious component.
5. `nstallation`: The previous step should install the malware on the target system.
6. `Command & Control (C2)`: The successful installation of the malware provides the attacker with a command and control ability over the target system.
7. `Actions on Objectives`: After gaining control over one target system, the attacker has achieved their objectives. One example objective is Data Exfiltration (stealing target’s data).
