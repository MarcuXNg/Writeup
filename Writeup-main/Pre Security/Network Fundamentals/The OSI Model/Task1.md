### Overall
- The OSI model (or Open Systems Interconnection Model) is an absolute fundamental model used in networking
- This critical model provides a framework dictating how all networked devices will send, receive and interpret data.
- The OSI model consists of seven layers which are illustrated (Each layer has a different set of responsibilities and is arranged from Layer 7 to Layer 1.)
- Benefits of OSI model: Devices can have different functions and designs on a network while communicating with other devices. Data sent across a network that follows the uniformity of the OSI model can be understood by other devices.
- At every individual layer that data travels through, specific processes take place, and pieces of information are added to this data (Encapsulation)
